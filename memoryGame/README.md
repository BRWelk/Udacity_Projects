    - Use images of universe as card images
    - Offer hints of last 3 moves (add border to cards) if player asks. 
      - Player gets 1 hint per game
      - Using hint adds 30 seconds to time
    - Card images disappear when matched, replaced by a black hole
    - Record user names and data, to provide win - loss, time and rating information.
