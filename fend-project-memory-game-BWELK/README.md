## Instructions

This is project 2 in the Udacity Front End Web Developer program. The Memory game is a fun way to test your memory by matching images. If you click this link [file:///C:/Users/bwelk/Desktop/Udacity_Projects/fend-project-memory-game-BWELK/index.html], it will take you to the game. Once you are there it is really simple.
Fun stuff to watch:
- The Star rating in the first header column, starts at 3. It counts the number attempts to match a pair (2 card flips). After 14 attempts, it becomes 2 stars. After 20 attempts it becomes one star. Pay close attention, it is easy to start clicking fast!!!

- Your moves are recorded as well. The second column will record every pair attempt, so you can keep track as you are playing.

- The third header column has your timer. The time starts recording on your first click and stops on the final pair match. I recommend working on getting your number of moves under 14 and then work towards shaving the time.

- The final header column is reset button, in case you get distracted and need to start over. This is usually a speed induced event.

 - Once you have made all your matches, a modal box will appear, with your stats. If you would like to play again, click "OK", if you would like to stop, click "Cancel".

<b>ENJOY!!!</b>


## Contributing
Udacity provided the starter template for this project. I was also fortunate enough to have great resources to help me understand how the JavaScript works in symphony with HTML, CSS and the DOM.

***BIG THANKS TO THE FOLLOWING INCREDIBLE PEOPLE***

- Salma, my Udacity mentor. She encourages me and is always there to provide help with code and suggesting ways to improve my projects and skills.

- Yahya Elharony for providing the Study Jam and helping me understand how the JavaScript works for this project. Working with DOM is a challenge, but it is a bit easier now. Thanks again Yahya.

- Richie Foreman, a Goolge employee who worked with me at #GrowWithGooge in Wichita, KS. He spent about an hour helping me understand the shuffle function and sorting my array.

- Zachary Welk, my son. A graduate from KU with an Engineering Degree in IT. He works for ZOOM Video Communications in the IT department. We used ZOOM to video chat and share my work screens so he could walk me through the JavaScript logic when I struggled.

Much time was spent in MDN learning about DOM and how to .get, document.innerHTML and query.

This project is my Frankenstein. I used a simple bootstrap type row/col setup and worked it together with my UL/LI and css to make it flex repsonsively. Please let me know what bugs are out there.
