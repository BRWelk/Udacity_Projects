## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

***BIG THANKS TO Yahya Elharony for providing the Study Jam and helping me understand how the JavaScript works for this project. Working with DOM is a challenge, but it is a bit easier now. Thanks again Yahya.***

A special thanks to Richie Foreman, a Goolge employee who worked with me at #GrowWithGooge in Wichita, KS. He spent about an hour helping me understand the shuffle function and sorting my array.

Much time was spent in MDN learning about DOM and how to .get, document.innerHTML and query.

I used a mix of flex column in the HTML and JavaScript to insert the list for the card deck. Working on getting the alert modal to restart the game
